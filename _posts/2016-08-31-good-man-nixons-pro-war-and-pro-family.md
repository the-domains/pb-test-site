# **Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.**

You know, I was God once. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Leela's gonna kill me. No! The cat shelter's on to me.

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Daylight and everything. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? **That's right, baby.**_I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much._ You even love anyone pretending to be him!

## **I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.**

A true inspiration for the children. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

1. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?
2. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
3. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

### **Look, last night was a mistake.**

But existing is basically all I do! Pansy. Large bet on myself in round one. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

* Shinier than yours, meatbag.
* Why yes! Thanks for noticing.
* No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

And why did 'I' have to take a cab? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Moving along... But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.

Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Why would a robot need to drink? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!

You don't know how to do any of those. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Is the Space Pope reptilian!?
